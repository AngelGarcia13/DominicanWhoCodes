# DominicanWho.Codes Roadmap

We decided to make a list of the things that will be added to the project, this way the contributors will have a better understanding about what's going on with DominicanWho.Codes  (**DWC**).

Let's start with the big picture, DWC is basically a devs directory where you could find out your next partner, employee or friend from the Dominican Republic, so we started with a simple app made with Blazor where we have the data in a JSON file.

In next releases there will be features like: Login/Register, Profile/Skills Management and Recommendations on other users profile.

This project is basically for me and my co-worker Manuel Hern√°ndez @ManuHernandez (and everybody who want to collaborate) to learn/use some of the main JS front-end frameworks (Angular, Vue and React), play with some WebAssembly technologies like Blazor and also implement a Microservices Architecture (using various technologies) for the back-end.
